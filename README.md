# Todo-list app
Here is a small project i did to test my react skills for the job im currently at, I really enjoyed doing this project and would love to work on projects at max kelsen.

# Sign-in
The sign-in page uses React/redux functions create and store password data, the user must enter a 4-digit name to allowed on to the next Dashboard section 
# Dashboard
The app is a simple To-do-list that allows the user to enter and store a To-do in a list. they can also re access the to-do using local memory. the user can click a todo and mark it as complete (with a clear theme change to signify the change) they can also click on a button to show all the completed to-dos they have done. 

Thanks,
Jarryd.
