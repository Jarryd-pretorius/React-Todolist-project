# Useverb Tasklist extension

Here is my skill test, Hope you enjoy using it :). its got some simple sass queries, state react aswell as some small redux functions for the login section. I really enjoyed doing this todo and would love to work on projects like this at UseVerb!.

kind regards,
Jarryd.
